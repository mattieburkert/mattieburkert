### helloWorld! 

I'm Mattie (she/they), an [Associate Professor of Digital Humanities](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/english/all/mburkert) and [Director of the Minor in DH](https://dh.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon, situated on the traditional Indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. 

I'm current working on a few research projects: 

- The London Stage Database (in active maintenance pending further funding): [website](https://londonstagedatabase.uoregon.edu) | [repo](https://github.com/LondonStageDB)
- A [network analysis project](https://github.com/mattieburkert/theater-sharers) drawing on data from archival 18th-century lawsuits and court cases
- A collaborative digital edition of *The Female American* (1767), Volume 2, for [Literature in Context](https://github.com/literatureInContext/)
