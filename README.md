### helloWorld! 

I'm Mattie (she/they), an [Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/english/all/mburkert) and [Director of the Minor in DH](https://dh.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon, situated on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional Indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. 

I'm current teaching the DH capstone, [English 470/570](https://eng470-s23.github.io/demo-site/), and working on two research projects: 

- The London Stage Database (in active maintenance pending further funding): [website](https://londonstagedatabase.uoregon.edu) | [repo](https://github.com/LondonStageDB)
- A [network analysis project](https://github.com/mattieburkert/theater-sharers) drawing on data from archival 18th-century lawsuits and court cases.
